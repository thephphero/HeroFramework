# The Hero Framework

## Intro

Hero Framework is yet another Symfony-based PHP Framework aimed at intermediate to seasoned developers. The framework was built from the ground up using Symfony Standalone Components available from the Symfony website. The main difference between Hero and other PHP Frameworks (even Symfony itself), is that Hero aims to be more practical, less bloated and hand control right back to the developer. We feel that you shouldn't have to forget PHP while coding PHP.   

Basically, we want to change the world by making things like routing, validation and security a bit less painful than in Symfony, but also a bit less automated than in Laravel. 

## Getting Started

Requirements
- Composer
- PHP > 7.0
- Apache2

## Installation
Install PHP dependencies using:

php composer install

## Configuration
Set up environment variables using the .env.dist template as a guide for what variables must be set. How you set these environment variables will be different depending on your platform.

## Usage
Configure your web server to point to the public folder present under root path. Alternatively, use PHP's built-in server like so:

php -S 127.0.0.1:8080 /path/to/public/

Open your browser and navigate to the domain pointing to your framework installation. If you are using the built-in server, then point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:8080

## Documentation
Unfortunatelly, other than this Readme, there is still no documentation available.
